# SPC-Melting
The objective for this respository is to develop the R language to a point where I can accurately present the capabilities of R, particularly shiny, in the hopes of using shiny server at my company to better visualize our company's massive amount of data.  To start, the focus will be on visualizing data using Shiny, SPC charting and other means associated with melting in one of 2 Electric Arc Furnaces' metrics, and chemistries.

To also visualize current processes real-time and have adjustable sensitivities to changes in the data that will send email alerts to a particular list of people.  This may include real-time notifications of manually entered data as well in the form of outliers.
